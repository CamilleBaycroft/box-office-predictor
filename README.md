# box-office-predictor
This project was put together as a submission for the Brainstation Data Science Bootcamp. The goal of this project was to see if we could look at certain factors during a movie's opening week to predict it's movie's box office.

I separated the factors that I was going to analyze into two different themes; 1) factors that help us understand how aware people are of a given movie, and 2) factors that help us understand how people feel about a given movie.
